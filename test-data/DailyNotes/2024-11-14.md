    ## Testing object references and indexes

    #verification This entry tests how the system handles different types of object references. It includes references to books like [Thinking Fast and Slow](Books/Thinking%20Fast%20and%20Slow.md), definitions like [Cognitive Bias](Definitions/Cognitive%20Bias.md), people like [Bob Johnson](People/Bob%20Johnson.md) and [Carol Martinez](People/Carol%20Martinez.md), organizations like [Stanford University](Organizations/Stanford%20University.md), and projects like [Journal Workflow](Projects/Journal%20Workflow.md).

    Each reference type should be routed to its appropriate index category. This entry also tests multiple person references: [David Chen](People/David%20Chen.md) should also appear in the People index. Tags like #documentation should appear in the Tags index.

    ## Testing embedded page removal

    Here's a link to a page that should be removed from the final PDF when it appears standalone:

    [Sample Page](Pages/Sample%20Page.md)

    But when I mention [Sample Page](Pages/Sample%20Page.md) inline like this, it should appear as plain text (not hyperlinked, since links won't work in hardcover books).
