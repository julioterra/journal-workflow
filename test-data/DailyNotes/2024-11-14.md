    ## Testing object references and names

    #verification Today I'm testing how the system handles different types of references. I've been reading [Thinking Fast and Slow](Books/Thinking%20Fast%20and%20Slow.md), which discusses [Cognitive Bias](Definitions/Cognitive%20Bias.md) in detail. It's fascinating stuff.

    I had coffee with [Bob Johnson](People/Bob%20Johnson.md) and [Carol Martinez](People/Carol%20Martinez.md) at [Stanford University](Organizations/Stanford%20University.md) where they're both working on the [Journal Workflow](Projects/Journal%20Workflow.md) project.

    The conversation reminded me of [David Chen](People/David%20Chen.md)'s comment last week about how important it is to have good #documentation for any project.

    ## Testing embedded page removal

    Here's a link to a page that should be removed from the final PDF when it appears standalone:

    [Sample Page](Pages/Sample%20Page.md)

    But when I mention [Sample Page](Pages/Sample%20Page.md) inline like this, it should remain as a regular link.
