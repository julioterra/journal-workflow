    ## Testing media embedding

    #success #installation Today I'm verifying that images and PDFs embed correctly in the final journal. Here's the workflow diagram that shows the entire process:

    [workflow-diagram](Images/workflow-diagram.md)

    And here's a helpful guide about what media types can be embedded in a physical book:

    ![media-types-guide](PDFs/Media/media-types-guide.pdf)
    [media-types-guide](PDFs/media-types-guide.md)

    ## Expected results

    If everything works correctly, the final PDF should show:

    - **Tags in blue**: #testing, #workflow, #setup, #project, #verification, #documentation, #success, #installation
    - **Names in red**: Alice Smith, Bob Johnson, Carol Martinez, David Chen
    - **Six indexes at the back**:
      - Books (Thinking Fast and Slow)
      - Definitions (Cognitive Bias)
      - Organizations (Stanford University)
      - People (Alice Smith, Bob Johnson, Carol Martinez, David Chen)
      - Projects (Journal Workflow)
      - Tags (all hashtags from these daily notes)
    - **Embedded media**: The workflow diagram image and media types guide PDF should appear in the document
    - **Standalone embed removed**: The standalone "Sample Page" link from November 14th should not appear
    - **Professional layout**: Proper margins, headers, page numbers, and book formatting

    This test verifies that all five filters are working correctly and the indexing system is functioning as expected!
