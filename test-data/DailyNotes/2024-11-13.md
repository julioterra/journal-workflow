    ## Setting up the journal workflow

    #workflow #setup Today I'm testing the journal workflow system to make sure everything is installed correctly. This is an exciting #project that will convert my journal entries into a beautifully formatted book.

    The workflow uses five different filters to process the markdown content and generate six comprehensive indexes at the back of the book. I'm curious to see how well the #tag highlighting works - all tags should appear in blue color.

    I learned about this system from [Alice Smith](People/Alice%20Smith.md), who recommended it highly. She's been using it for her personal journal for months now.
