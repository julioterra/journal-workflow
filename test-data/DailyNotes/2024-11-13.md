    ## Setting up the journal workflow

    #workflow #setup This test entry demonstrates the journal workflow system. The workflow uses four different filters to process markdown content and generates six comprehensive indexes at the back of the book.

    This entry tests #tag highlighting functionality. Tags like #project should appear in blue color and be indexed in the Tags section.

    This entry also tests person references like [Alice Smith](People/Alice%20Smith.md), which should be indexed in the People section.
